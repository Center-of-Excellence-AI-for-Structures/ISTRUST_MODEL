# ISTRUST_model
Code for the paper "Breaking the black box barrier: predicting remaining useful life under uncertainty from raw images with interpretable neural networks". This is a novel interpretable transformer-based model for Remaining Useful Life (RUL) prediction from raw sequential images (frames) representing a composite structure under fatigue loads
